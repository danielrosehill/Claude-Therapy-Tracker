Help the user review their therapy progress over a specified time period.

**Your Task:**

Analyze the user's therapy journey by reviewing session debriefs, goals, and other relevant documentation to provide meaningful insights about their progress.

**Workflow:**

1. **Determine Scope:**
   - Ask what time period to review (e.g., "last month", "last 3 sessions", "since June", "all sessions")
   - Ask if they want to focus on specific themes or goals, or a general overview

2. **Gather Information:**
   - Read session debriefs from `/therapy-sessions/debriefs/`
   - Review goals from `/goal-tracking/goals/`
   - Check relevant context in `/context/`
   - Review any planning documents in `/planning/`

3. **Analyze and Report:**
   Create a progress report in `/outputs/` that includes:
   - **Summary**: Overall trajectory and patterns
   - **Key Themes**: Recurring topics or concerns
   - **Progress on Goals**: Status of tracked therapeutic goals
   - **Insights**: Connections or patterns you notice
   - **Techniques Used**: What therapeutic approaches have been explored
   - **Growth Areas**: Where progress is evident
   - **Areas for Focus**: Topics that may benefit from continued attention
   - **Recommendations**: Suggestions for future sessions or self-work

4. **Offer Follow-ups:**
   - Suggest updating goals based on progress
   - Offer to create visualizations of progress (if applicable)
   - Ask if they want to discuss any specific findings

**Guidelines:**
- Be encouraging but honest
- Highlight both progress and ongoing challenges
- Look for patterns across multiple sessions
- Respect the complexity of therapeutic work - progress isn't always linear
- Use empathetic, supportive language
- Focus on growth, not just problem-solving
