This repository is a template that was cloned from Github.

It's a template for using Claude Code to track therapy visits - intended for patients/users.

The README clearly defines the objective of this project. 

Your task is to seed some initial personalisations so that the template can be "the user's".

If you know the user's name from external context, you can make some of these independently. If you don't, you can ask for it. 

Your core setup should be updating CLAUDE.md with these personalisations.

After doing that, ask them if they have existing context data which they would like you to help populate. You can delegate this task to the subagent.
