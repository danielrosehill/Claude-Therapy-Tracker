# Context Folder Purpose - Note For Agents

This is the base of the context folder in this repository. 

The context folder Is intended as a lightweight form of "RAG" - providing context data about the user that is intended to be persistent across sessions. 

This context data should be used to frame your responses to the user through. It should be periodically updated. And periodically organized to enable easy parsing. 

All information that is handled in your interactions with the user will be context data.
